<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Najad Ahmad K M, a 19-year-old currently in my third year of pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization
 in Data Science. I have always been drawn to the world of technology, and my academic journey has deepened my understanding of how data drives
  decisions, innovations, and real-world solutions. I’m constantly exploring new concepts in programming, analytics, and machine learning as I 
  prepare myself for a future in the tech industry.</p>

<p>Outside the classroom, I’m passionate about sports—especially football and athletics. Whether I’m playing on the field or watching a match,
 sports have always played a huge role in my life. As a footballer, I’ve developed qualities that extend beyond the game: staying calm under 
 pressure, maintaining consistency, and working effectively as part of a team. These strengths not only define my playing style but also influence 
 how I approach challenges in academics and daily life.</p>

<p>Beyond academics and athletics, I enjoy spending time with friends and going out to unwind. I believe in balancing hard work with meaningful
 moments and staying grounded no matter the situation. I’m someone who believes in steady growth, learning through experience, and staying true to
  my passions. Whether on the field or behind a screen of code, I always strive to give my best and keep improving every day.</p>
